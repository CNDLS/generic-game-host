The kinds of processes we’re looking at and that we’re going to try and promote in these tasks include attention, awareness, levels of awareness. They have to process in activation of prior knowledge, working memory…and with this knowledge, we can design these tasks so we can get our students to be comfortably engaged as they do the tasks."</p>
